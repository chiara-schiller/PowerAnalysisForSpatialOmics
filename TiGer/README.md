# spatialpower
final code package for spatial power analysis and tissue generation paper. name subject to change. 


## Overview
This is a package for _in silico_ tissue generation and visualization. PackageName is useful for generating datasets for _in silico_ ground truthing, generation of spatial null models, testing of new algorithms for spatially-resolved single cell biology, and power analysis.

## Dependencies
PackageName is written for Python 3.7.3. 

It requires the following dependencies: 

- `numpy == 1.17.3`
- `matplotlib == 3.1.2`
- `pandas == 0.25.3`
- `networkx == 2.4`
- `joblib == 0.15.1`
- `scipy == 1.4.1`
- `jax == 0.1.62`

Example noteboooks make invoke additional dependencies, but are not required for the base functionality of PackageName. 

## Installation
1. Install appropriate dependencies. 
2. `pip install packageName` or `conda install -c [dev] packageName` 

We also make a Docker image available here. 

## Usage

We provide several notebooks as examples on potential uses of PackageName:
1. Tissue generation
2. Tissue labeling from existing scaffold
3. Using _in silico_ tissue for spatial power analysis [Citation]

PackageName can also be called from the command line for generation of tissues:
`example command goes here`.
